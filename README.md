# Material Creator Window
## Overview
A small tool to transform textures into materials
(as long as they respect the format `[ProjectName/ModelName]_[MaterialName]_[TextureTypeName]` example: `elevator5_Bac_Height`)

And there is no documentation yet but with time it will come (and better versions too).
